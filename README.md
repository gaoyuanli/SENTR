# Split-intron ENabled Trans-splicing Riboregulators (SENTR)
SENTR is a class of programmable riboregulators based on group I intron mediated trans-splicing. SENTR functions by seperating target mRNA into two strands, 5'RNA and 3'RNA, and rejoin them through RNA splicing. We fused de-novo designed external guide sequences (EGSs) to the intron halves, to improve the efficiency, programmability, predictability with machine-learning, and orthogonality of conventional split intron design. 
This repository deposits:
1) The source data file for the paper
2) The NUPACK scripts to design the EGS library, orthogonal EGS library and other EGS structures for mRNA sensing and ribocomputing
3) The sequences, performance data, and codes for machine-learning
